        Parameters
        ----------
        thrust_source : int, float, callable, string, array
            Motor's thrust curve. Can be given as an int or float, in which
            case the thrust will be considered constant in time. It can
            also be given as a callable function, whose argument is time in
            seconds and returns the thrust supplied by the motor in the
            instant. If a string is given, it must point to a .csv or .eng file.
            The .csv file shall contain no headers and the first column must
            specify time in seconds, while the second column specifies thrust.
            Arrays may also be specified, following rules set by the class
            Function. See help(Function). Thrust units are Newtons.
        burn_time: float, tuple of float, optional
            Motor's burn time.
            If a float is given, the burn time is assumed to be between 0 and the
            given float, in seconds.
            If a tuple of float is given, the burn time is assumed to be between
            the first and second elements of the tuple, in seconds.
            If not specified, automatically sourced as the range between the first- and
            last-time step of the motor's thrust curve. This can only be used if the
            motor's thrust is defined by a list of points, such as a .csv file, a .eng
            file or a Function instance whose source is a list.
        dry_mass : int, float
            The total mass of the motor structure, including chambers
            and tanks, when it is empty and does not contain any propellant.

            to the motor's coordinate system when it is devoid of propellant.
            See `Motor.coordinate_system_orientation`.
        dry_inertia : tuple, list
            Tuple or list containing the motor's dry mass inertia tensor
            components, in kg*m^2. This inertia is defined with respect to the
            the `center_of_dry_mass` position.
            Assuming e_3 is the rocket's axis of symmetry, e_1 and e_2 are
            orthogonal and form a plane perpendicular to e_3, the dry mass
            inertia tensor components must be given in the following order:
            (I_11, I_22, I_33, I_12, I_13, I_23), where I_ij is the
            component of the inertia tensor in the direction of e_i x e_j.
            Alternatively, the inertia tensor can be given as (I_11, I_22, I_33),
            where I_12 = I_13 = I_23 = 0.
        grains_center_of_mass_position : float
            Position of the center of mass of the grains in meters. More specifically,
            the coordinate of the center of mass specified in the motor's coordinate

            Motor's nozzle outlet radius in meters.
        nozzle_position : int, float, optional
            Motor's nozzle outlet position in meters, in the motor's coordinate
            system. See `Motor.coordinate_system_orientation` for details.
            Default is 0, in which case the origin of the coordinate system
            is placed at the motor's nozzle outlet.
        throat_radius : int, float, optional
            Motor's nozzle throat radius in meters. Used to calculate Kn curve.
            Optional if the Kn curve is not interesting. Its value does not
            impact trajectory simulation.
        reshape_thrust_curve : boolean, tuple, optional
            If False, the original thrust curve supplied is not altered. If a
            tuple is given, whose first parameter is a new burn out time and
            whose second parameter is a new total impulse in Ns, the thrust
            curve is reshaped to match the new specifications. May be useful
            for motors whose thrust curve shape is expected to remain similar
            in case the impulse and burn time varies slightly. Default is
            False.
        interpolation_method : string, optional
            Method of interpolation to be used in case thrust curve is given
            by data set in .csv or .eng, or as an array. Options are 'spline'
            'akima' and 'linear'. Default is "linear".
        coordinate_system_orientation : string, optional
            Orientation of the motor's coordinate system. The coordinate system
            is defined by the motor's axis of symmetry. The origin of the
            coordinate system  may be placed anywhere along such axis, such as
            at the nozzle area, and must be kept the same for all other
            positions specified. Options are "nozzle_to_combustion_chamber" and
            "combustion_chamber_to_nozzle". Default is "nozzle_to_combustion_chamber".
